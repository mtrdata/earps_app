# Women's Football Goalkeeping Scouting Application

Final university project. A 6-week long full stack project where I scrapped & cleaned data from FBREF, used an XGBoost model to create a rating system and built an application for scouts & analysts to search & compare goalkeepers from the top 5 European leagues in women's football.
